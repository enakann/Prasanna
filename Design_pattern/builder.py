"""1)Separate the construction of complex object from
its representation so that you can use the same construction process
for different types of objects

2)Parse a complex representation and create one
of several target objects out of it

3)Product will be of aggregate object ,which will be a part of several object.

4)Different type of builder build different parts

5)Ideal if the construction process occures in a number of disceate steps

6)Strict separation between data representation and construction process

7) Conveniner when a single product can be represented by several representations

8)offers fine-grained control over construcion process
