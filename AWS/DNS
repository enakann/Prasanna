Domain Registrars - godaddy.com,

When you bought a domain
Every dns record starts with SOA
SOA - Start Of Authority

The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
The administrator of the zone
The current version of the data file
the default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records

hellocloudgurur --> .com ---> NS(Name Server records) --> SOA

hellocloudguru2019.com  172800 IN NS ns.awsdns.com

A record is the fundamental type of DNS record,the "A" in a A record
stands for "Address".The A record is used by a computer to translate
the name of the domain to an IP address

for example http://www.acloudguru might point t http://123.10.10.80


Routing Policies
----------------
1.Simple Routing
   Just enter the ip address ,it gives back randomly
2.Weighted Routing
   Weight based routing
3.Latency Based Routing
   Route traffic based on the latency on the network
4.Failover Routing Policy:
   Active/Standy architecture
   if active fails traffic will be routed to stanby
5.Geolocation Routing policy
    This lets you choose where your traffic will be sent
    based on the georpahical location of your users
    For example,you might want all queries from Europe to be routedd
    to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for your european customers
6.Geoproximity Routing
    Lets you route traffic based on the location of the user and the resource
    It used bias as factor ,we must use traffic flow
7.Multivalue Answer
   same as simple routing policy but allows you to put health check on each records
