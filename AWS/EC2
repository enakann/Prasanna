* Termination protection is turned off by default ,you must turn it on
* On an EBS-backed instance,the default action is for the root
EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
* EBS root volume of you default ami's cannot be encrypted
* Additional volumes can be encrypted

* All inbound traffic is blocked by default
* All Outbound traffic is allowed
* Changes to security group take effect immediately
* you can have any number of Ec2 instances within a security group
* You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances
* Security groups are stateful
* If you create inbound rule allowing traffic ,that traffic is
  automatically allowed back out again
* You cannot block specific IP address using security group,
instead use Network Access Control Lists
* You can specify allow rules but not deny rules


EBS
=====

Elastic block storage

EBS provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2
instance with AWS cloud

Each EBS volume is automatically replicated within its AZ to protect you
from component failure ,offering high availability and durability

* Genreral Purpose (SSD) [gp2] - (Most work loads)General purpose SSD volume that balances price
     and performance for a wide variety of transactional workloads

* Provisioned IOPS(SSD) [io1] - (Databases) Highest performance SSD volume designed for mission critical applications

* Throughput Optimized(HDD) [st1] - (Big data & Ware house) Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed ,throuhput-intesive workloads

* Cold HDD [sc1] - (file servers) Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

* EBS Magnetic (Previous generation HDD) Workloads where the data is infrequntly accessed

Volumes & Snapshot
==================
* EBS volume will be same AZ as EC2
* To move volume to another AZ:
     Create a snapshot -- Create Image(AMI) --- Create EC2 instance in different AZ
     Create a snapshot -- Copy AMI (from one region to another)
* If I terminate Ec2 instance is deleted only root volume will be terminated
  but the additional volumes will persist (will not be deleted)

* TO Create a snapshot for AMaxon EBS volumes that servers as root device
  you should stop the instances before taking the snapshot
* You can create AMI from both volumes and snapshosts
* You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly,including changing the size and storage type
* Volumes will always be in the same AZ as teh EC2 instance

AMI Types
==========
(EBS vs Instance Store)

You can select AMI based on :
* Region
* Operating system
* Architecture
* Launch Permissions
* Storage for the root device(Root device volume)
    - Instance store (Ephemeral Storage)
    - EBS Backed volumes
 EBS: The root decice for an instance launced from the AMI is an amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
 Instance Store Volumes: THe root device for an instance launced from the AMI is an instance
                        store volume create
 If EC2 is stopped instance store volumes will be deleted
 By default both EBS & Instance store root volume will be deleted but we can tell
  it to keep the root volume for EBS backed instances

Encrypted Root device volumes & snapshots
==========================================
How to Encrypt rot

provision Ec2 with uncrypted volume -- Take a snapshot -- make a copy of snapshot
while copying encrypt the device -- create AMI --provision Ec2 from this AMI

Now we can encrypt the root volume while provisioning itself

* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are ecnrypted
* volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted
* You can share snapshots but only if they are unencrypted
* These snapshots can be share with other AWS accounts or made public


CloudWatch 101
===============

Cloud watch is the monitoring services
Cloudwatch can monitor things like
* Compute:
    * Ec2 Instance
    * Autoscaling groups
    * Route53 Health checks

* Cloud watch can monitor at host level
  CPU
  Network
  Disk
  Status check

* Cloud Trail -- Increases visibility into you user
 and resource activity by recording AWS Management console

* Cloud Trail records API calls
* CLoudwatch with EC2 will monitor events every 5 minutes by default
* You can create cloud watch alarm which trigger notifications
* Cloudwatch is all about performance ,CloudTrail is all about auditing

EFS
===
We cannot have 2 EC2 instance sharing a EBS volume
but 2 EC2 can share EFS

Amazon EFS,storage capacity is elastic,growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files
so your applications have the storage they need,when they need it

Storage -EFS
Different AZ it can spread

Throughput
----------
Bursting
Provisioned

Performance mode
---------------
General Purpose
Max I/O

Enable Encryption
-----------------
 KMS

To make EFS work nfs-utils should be installed
Add NFS to the security group

cd /var/www
mount -t efs -o tls fs-9816b269:/ /var/www/html


Exam
----
Support NFS4 protocol
You only pay for storage you use
can scale up to petabytes
Can support thousand of concurrent NFS connections
Data is stored across multiple AZ within region
Read Write Consistency


EC2 Placement Groups
====================

Way of Placing EC2

1.Clustered Placement group
2.Spread Placement group
3.Partitioned


* Clustered Placement Group (Low latency /high throuhput)
---------------------------

A cluster placement group is a grouping of instance
within a single AZ
Placement groups are recommened for applications that need low network latency
high network throughput or both

* Spread (Individual critical Ec2 instances)
---------

A spread placement group is a group of instance that are each
placed on distinct underlying hardware
Spread Placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small
number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other


* Paritioned
------------
Similar to Spread
- When using it Ec2 divides each group into logical segments partitions
Amazon Ec2 ensures that each partitions
- We can have multiple instance in the partitions
Each rack has its own network and power source

FIGHTDRMCPXZAU

All incoming traffic is blocked by default,outgoing is not blocked
Security groups are stateful
You cannot specific IP address using Security groups
You can only specify allow rules in SG

EBS
----
General purpose (gp1)
Provisioned IOPS (iop1)
Trhough optimized (st1)
Cold storage (sc1)
Standard

Volumes exists on EBS
snapshots exists on s3
snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
snapshots are incrementl -this means that only delta is stored

You should stop ec2 before snaphost for best result
VOlumes always be in the same AZ as EC2
you can change EBS volumes sizes on the fly,including changing hthe size and storage type
You can create AMI's from both Volumes and snapshots

Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encypted
Only unencrypted snapshots can be shared


Instance store volume are ephemeral
Instance stores volumes cannot be stopped if the host fails
EBS backed instances can be stopped
you can reboot both,you will not loose data
By default both root volumes will be deleted on termination,However with EBS
   volumes you can tell aws to keep the root device volume

CloudWatch
----------
Dashboards
Alarms -Allows you to set alarms that notify you when particular
Events - helps you to respond to state change in you aws resouced -
Logs - aggregate,monitor and store logs

Cloudwatch -- Performance
CloudTrail -- Monitor API calls
