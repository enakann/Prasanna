IAM is universal,It does not apply to regions
New users have NO permission when first created
New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
Access Key ID & Secret Access Key
Always setup Multifactor authentication on your root account
You can create and cusomize your own password rotation policies

Create Billing Alarm
---------------------
We can create billing alarm through Cloudwatch alarms

====
S3 =
====

S3 is a safe place to store your files
It is object based storage (0 to 5TB)
Files are stored in bucket
S3 is a universal namespace (ie it should be universally unique)https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

Each object:
   Key (this is simply the name of the object)
   Value(this is the data)
   VersionId(important for versioning)
   Metadata(data about data)
   Subresources:
       ACL
       torrents

Data consistency model:
-----------------------
* Read after write consistency for PUTS for new objects
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

S3 has the following features
-----------------------------
Tiered storage available
Life cycle management
Versioning
Encryption
MFA Delete
Secure your data using ACL and bucket policies

S3 Storage Classes
-------------------
1.S3 standard
2.S3-IA (Infrequently accessed)
3.S3 One Zone - IA
4.S3 Intelligent Tiering
5.S3 Glacier
6.S3 Glacier Deep Archive

S3 Charges
---------
Storage
Requests
Storage Management Pricing
Data Transfer pricing
Transfer acceleration
Cross Region replication pricing

Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using bucket policies

Encryption
----------
BY default ,all newly created buckets are private,you can setup acess control your bucket using
* Bucket policies
* Acess Control Lists

S3 bucket can be configured to create access logs
which log all request made to s3 bucket
This can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account

Encryption in Transit is achieved by https (SSL/TLS)
Encryption at Rest:
   Server Side:
      * S3 Managed keys - SSE-S3
      * AWS key Management service,managed keys SSE-KMS
      * Server side with client provided keys -> SSE-C
   Client Side:
      * client encrypt the file and upload it to S3

Versioning
----------

Stores all version of an object
Once enabled ,versioning cannot be disabled
Integrate with Lifecycle rules
MFA delete capability
With versioning ON if file is deleted it only keeps delete marked on it but it doesnt delete the file
with versioning oFF if file is deletes it actually deletes it


Life cycle Management
--------------------

Use LCM rules to manage your objects
Automate transition to tiered storage
Expire objects when needed

1)Create a Life cycle rule
2)Storage class transition for current version and previous version
3)Transistion to S-IA after 30 days
4)We can configure expiration for current version and previous version
5)Clean up incomplete multipart uploads

Cross Region Replication
------------------------
Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
Regions must be unique
Files in an existig bucket are not replicated automatically
All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
Delete markers are not replicated
Deleting individual version or delete markers will not be replicated


S3 Transfer acceleration
-------------------------

S3 Transfer acceleration utilised the cloudfront edge network to caccelerate your uploads to se.
Instead of uploading directly to your s3 bucket,you can use a distinct URL to upload
directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to s3.
you will get a distinct URL to upload to


CloudFront
---------

Content delivery network(CDN)

Edge Location - This is the location where the content will be cached
Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute,
  This can be an S3 Bucket ,an EC2 intance,ELB
Distribution-collection of Edge locations

Content will be cached based on TTL
Amazon cloud

We can restrict cloud front using singed url or cookies
we can use web application firewall

Edge locations are not just readonly you can write to them aswel
You can invalidate cached objects but you will be charged


Snowball
---------
Snowball is a petabyte-scale hard disk

Storage Gateway
---------------
Storage gateway that connects an on-premised software applicance

File Gateway (NFS & SMB)
Volume Gateway(iSCSI)
 * Stored Volumes

File Gateway - Flat files,stored directly on s3

Volume Gateway:
  Stored volume - Entire data set is stored on site and its asyncly backe upt to s3
  cached volume - Entire data set is stored on s3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site
